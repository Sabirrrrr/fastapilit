# API Endpoint Routing Issue: Upgrade to Corporate Functionality

## Problem Description
The upgrade button in the footer was not functioning due to a mismatch between frontend and backend API endpoint routing.

## Root Cause
In the backend (`main.py`), the upgrade router was configured with the prefix:
```python
app.include_router(upgrade.router, prefix="/api/upgrade", tags=["upgrade"])
```

However, in the frontend, the initial API call was attempting to reach:
- Incorrect: `/api/upgrade-to-corporate`
- Correct: `/api/upgrade/upgrade-to-corporate`

## Symptoms
- 404 (Not Found) error when clicking the "Upgrade to Corporate" button
- Button appeared disabled or unresponsive
- No visible error messages in the UI

## Solution Steps
1. Update frontend upgrade service endpoint:
```typescript
// Before
const response = await fetch(`${this.API_URL}/upgrade-to-corporate`, {...})

// After
const response = await fetch(`${this.API_URL}/upgrade/upgrade-to-corporate`, {...})
```

2. Add comprehensive logging for better debugging:
- Log token
- Log full URL
- Log response status
- Log response headers
- Log response body

## Key Learnings
- Always ensure frontend and backend API routes are exactly matched
- Implement detailed logging for easier troubleshooting
- Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests

## Best Practices
- Implement consistent API routing conventions
- Use environment-based configuration for API endpoints
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
